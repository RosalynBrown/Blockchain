1. First I navigated to the Blockchain folder where my Ethereum Tools are saved then created my first node named “one” using the code below. I noted the public address to use later.

`./geth --datadir one account new`

Public address of the key:   0x2A1B6153666d0b657fffb13Ed576728f730Bac4C
Path of the secret key file: one/keystore/UTC--2021-08-27T23-21-05.519760000Z--2a1b6153666d0b657fffb13ed576728f730bac4c

2. 2.	Next I set up my next node using the code below with the name “two” and making note of the public key to use later.
